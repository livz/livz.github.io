## Overview

This trick might be useful at some point and it's not very obvious how to do at first. So let's see how to change a folder's icon:
1. Open the image to want to use as the icon in _Preview_ and select _Edit → Copy_ to copy the image in the clipboard.
2. Select the folder you wish to customise, then _Right click → Get Info_.
3. In the top left corner, click the folder image, then select _Edit → Paste_:
![folder-icon](/assets/images/tips/folder-icon.png)

To remove the custom image and restore the default folder icon, in Step 2 above select _Edit → Cut_. _Simple as that!_
