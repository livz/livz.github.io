## Overview

<blockquote>
  <p>A DMG file is a mountable disk image created in Mac OS X. It contains raw block data typically compressed and sometimes encrypted. DMG files are commonly used for OS X software installers that are downloaded from the Internet and mounts a virtual disk on the desktop when opened.</p>

[*__Universal binaries__*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary) are executables or application bundles that run natively on PowerPC or 32/64 bit Macintosh computers. They are larger in size (hence the name **_fat binaries_**) since they contain code compiled for multiple architectures. However, they contain library code shared between architectures so the total size is still less than the sum of individual binaries for each arch.
