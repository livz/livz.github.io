## Overview

Not too many people know or use this feature, but having multiple desktops can help organise your work and avoid clutter.
 
* To __*view the current desktops*__, simply *swipe the touchpad with three fingers up*, or use **```CTRL (^) + UP```** shortcut:

* If you hover over the names, you can actually see the content on each of them:

* To __*add a new desktop*__, simply click the big plus button on the top right corner of the screen.
* To __*delete a workspace*__, hover with the mouse over and an 'X' sign will appear in its top left corner:

* To __*switch between workspaces*__ is also pretty straight-forward: **swipe the touchpad with three fingers left/right** or use **```CTRL(^) + LEFT/RIGHT```** shortcuts to move to the previous/next workspace. 
* To __*switch directly to a specific workspace*__ number, enable global shortcuts in *Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Mission Control*:

* You may wonder how you could __*move a window from one workspace to another*__. It's possible and very simple: select the window and press the combination for the destination desktop (*e.g. ```CMD + 3```*), or just drag the window to the top of the screen, wait for the destination desktop to appear and drop it there:
