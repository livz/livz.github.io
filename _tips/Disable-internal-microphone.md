## Overview

A very simple but worth mentioning tip. If you ever want to _disable the built-in microphopne_ there is no checkbox or mute button but you can use the volume slider as below:

Then, make sure that it is not picking up any sound by watching the input level indicator.

This also has a security benefit since input capturing is a common feature of malware. Remember, _only the paranoid survive!_
