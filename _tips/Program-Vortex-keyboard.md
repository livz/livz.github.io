There is no official manual for the [Vortex Race 3](https://kotaku.com/vortex-race-3-keyboard-review-the-75-percent-solution-1797341501) 75% mechanical keyboard I got recently, but the programming instructions from the [POK3R user manual](http://www.vortexgear.tw/db/upload/webdata4/6vortex_20166523361966663.pdf) still apply almost exactly:

To program one of the layers 2-4 (the first one cannot be programmed) follow the following steps:
1. Choose the layer you want to program (**Fn + <,>**).
2. Enter the programming mode **Fn + Right Ctrl**. _Spacebar right LED should lit steadily_.
3. Press the key you want to program. _Spacebar right LED flashing_.
4. Press the keys you want and then press **Pn**. _Spacebar right LED lit steadily again_.
5. Repeat to program other keys.
6. Press **Fn + Right Ctrl** to exit programming mode. _Spacebar right LED off_.


Although there is already a MacOS layer, at minimum you probably would want to map these combinations as well, to benefit from the extra _Home_ and _End_ keys:
```
⌘ + Left  (CMD + Left) → Home 
⌘ + Right (CMD + Left) → End
```

## Notes

* Every key can program up to _**32 key strokes**_.
* To reset a programmed layer, press and hold **FN + R**. Spacebar left LED will flash for around 5 seconds, then the layer will be restore to default.
