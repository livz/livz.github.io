## Context
First I would like to give credit to the author of the picture I've used above, taken from [pxleyes](http://www.pxleyes.com/photoshop-pictures/minesweeper/). It's awesome, thank you! :pray: 

After reading [Game Hacking: WinXP Minesweeper](https://0x00sec.org/t/game-hacking-winxp-minesweeper/1266) I realised I wanted to do something similar but on a Linux system. This would be a great opportunity for me to learn some new skills, like debuging stripped GTK applications or becoming a GDB ninja (not!) while doing something interesting and with potential applications outsie this gaming example.

My goal in this post is to reverse engineer the GNOME Minesweeper game and locate relevant areas in memory to patch. As a bonus, let's make this as visually pleasing as possible!

### Pre-requisites
To follow along, you need at least basic reversing knowledge. Familiarity with GDB is always good. Most important of course is interest and

## Debugging GTK applications

## Static analysis 

## Reverse engineering GTK 

## GDB Kung-Fu

## CSS beautification
