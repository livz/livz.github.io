[UnderTheWire](http://underthewire.tech/index.htm) is an awesome website that hosts a number of PowerShell-based wargames meant to help Infosecurity people, either get started with or improve their PowerShell skills. I believe challenges and wargames like this one are a great way to learn *by doing* as they often cover rare and less known situations and involve problem solving. Other very interesting wargames I've written about are [OverTheWire](http://craftware.xyz/blog/categories/#OverTheWire), [Nebula](http://craftware.xyz/ctf/2012/07/21/Nebula-wargame-walkthrough.html), [Binar Master](http://craftware.xyz/blog/categories/#Binary-Master). 

The UnderTheWire wargames could be described as designed for Windows security professionals, Blue Team members or security tools designers. Currently there are 5 sets of levels of increasing difficulty. 

In this post I'll go through my solutions to the forth batch of 15 levels - [Oracle](http://underthewire.tech/oracle/oracle.htm). New topics covered in this set are:
* Working with files (looping, hashing, etc.)
* Filtering through Windows event logs
* Group policies
* Extracting recently visited websites from Windows registry
* Extracting remote desktop sessions from Windows registry

For the solutions to the other games check:
* [Level 1 - Century]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-10-UnderTheWire-Century %})
* [Level 2 - Cyborg]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-12-UnderTheWire-Cyborg %})
* [Level 3 - Groot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-14-UnderTheWire-Groot %})
* [Level 5 - Trebek]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-18-UnderTheWire-Trebek %}) 

Before starting, I wanted to say a huge thank you to the creators of these games for the effort of designing and hosting them, and making them available for free for everyone!
