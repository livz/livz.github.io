Last week I've been to the 5th SecTalks London meetup and I'm proud to say I've learnt something that evening and wanted to say Thank you to the creator of the night's challenge - @leigh.  I'll definitely be going again.

Below is a write-up of my solution. Hopefully by now the details of the challenge are made public so if people are still working on this I won't spoil anyone's fun by publishing this.

## Stage 0

The challenge is Christmas themed and  starts at the North Pole: 178.62.xx.xx/1.html
