[UnderTheWire](http://underthewire.tech/index.htm) is an awesome website that hosts a number of PowerShell-based wargames meant to help Infosecurity people, either get started with or improve their PowerShell skills. I believe challenges and wargames like this one are a great way to learn *by doing* as they often cover rare and less known situations and involve problem solving. Other very interesting wargames I've written about are [OverTheWire]({{ site.url }}/blog/categories/#OverTheWire), [Nebula]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-07-21-Nebula-wargame-walkthrough %}), [Binar Master]({{ site.url }}/blog/categories/#Binary-Master). 

The UnderTheWire wargames could be described as designed for Windows security professionals, Blue Team members or security tools designers. Currently there are 5 sets of levels of increasing difficulty. 

In this post I'll go through my solutions to the last batch of 15 levels - [Trebek](http://underthewire.tech/trebek/trebek.htm). This level is definitely more interesting and covers topics like working with Windows scheduled tasks, event logs parsing (*a lot of!*) and more auto-run tricks.

For the solutions to the other games check:
* [Level 1 - Century]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-10-UnderTheWire-Century %})
* [Level 2 - Cyborg]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-12-UnderTheWire-Cyborg %})
* [Level 3 - Groot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-14-UnderTheWire-Groot %})
* [Level 4 - Oracle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-16-UnderTheWire-Oracle %})

Before starting, I wanted to say a huge thank you to the creators of these games for the effort of designing and hosting them, and making them available for free for everyone!

## Trebek 1

<blockquote>
  <p>The password for trebek2 is the name of the script referenced in a deleted task as depicted in the event logs on the desktop PLUS the name of the text file on the user's desktop.</p>
</blockquote>

Connect to the first level by SSHing to *trebek.underthewire.tech*, on port *6001*. The credentials for the first level are ```trebek1/trebek1```.

First the file on the Desktop:

```posh
PS C:\Users\trebek1.UNDERTHEWIRE\Documents> ls ..\Desktop

    Directory: C:\Users\trebek1.UNDERTHEWIRE\Desktop

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----        5/13/2017   6:46 PM              0 994
```

Next we'll list all the events for deleted tasks and grep through the output for the commands being executed:

```posh
PS C:\Users\trebek1.UNDERTHEWIRE\Desktop> Get-WinEvent -Path ..\Desktop\Security.evtx | Where {$_.Message -Like "*task was deleted*"} | Format-List -Property Message | Out-String -Stream | Select-String -Pattern "Command" -Context 1,2
      <Exec>
        <Command>C:\Program Files\Bitvise SSH Server\BssCtrl.exe</Command>
        <Arguments>-startMinimized</Arguments>
      </Exec>
[..]
      <Exec>
        <Command>C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe</Command>
        <Arguments>-NonInteractive -NoLogo -NoProfile -File 'c:\users\trebek1\mess_cleaner.ps1'</Arguments>
      </Exec>
```

<div class="box-note">
Note that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/out-string?view=powershell-6" target="_blank">Out-String -Stream</a> is very important here. This is needed to be able to use <b>Select-String</b> and grep through the output!
</div>

So the password for level 2 is: ```mess_cleaner994```.
