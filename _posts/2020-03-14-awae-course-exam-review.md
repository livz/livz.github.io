## Overview

I was very excited when I found out about [AWAE - Advanced Web Attacks And Exploitation Training](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/). If this was to be in line with the other Offsec courses, it had to be well worth doing it. And I wasn't dissappointed. The course is well structured and goes well beyond classic vulnerabilities examples. The best things, in my opinion, about this course are that:

* Each chapter is a scenario that chains together multiple vulnerabilities to go from web to RCE
* Each chapter has exercises and solutions but also *Extra Mile* challenges that force you to go on your own and find solutions.
* There are many topics covered, mostly around vulnerabilities taht can be found via code review: a lot of applciation logic flaws, XSS, XSRF, blind SQLi, a lot of authentication bypasses
* They force you to become good with (or at least understand and craft some code) in many programming languages: Perl, Python, Java, JavaScript, C#

Time-wise, I took the 3 month 
## Challenge

Before being able to register for the CTP training, you're required to pass a short, fun, multi-staged challenge. You can attempt the challenge before paying for the actual course. The challenge starts on the web and finishes with some low-level assembly stuff. If you liked the challenge you'll definitely love the course.

keep going 
try harder

## Study

After reading through other reviews, I didn't dive straight into the course after the challenge. I prepared by going through various exploit development resources. There are many many places with good documentation but I wanted to list at least the following, which group together a lot of techniques and are very detailed and relevant:
* [Corelan exploit development tutorials](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/articles/)
* [FuzzySecurity Exploit tutorials](http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/exploits.html)

One month of lab time is more than enough to complete the exercises from all the chapters in the course, but extra work will prove very useful. Also, as a prerequisite, Python and reverse engineering skills helped a lot. Especially for the manual shellcode encoding module, which requires some automation. Fun times!

## Exam

The exam is not easy and requires concentration (and inspiration:), not only a good understanding of the techniques used in the lab. The problems cover all the topics from the lab (including the one you're thinking _"I won't get this, it's impossible to get it done in time!"_). Some problems have small tricks (which may seem bigger, depending on how confident you are about the topic and ultimately how much you've practised).

I've used both the allocated days for the exam, with a lot of sleep in between (~8h). It's very important not to panic and, if something doesn't work, keep hammering :)

Overall, I learned a lot while preparing for the exam. The course is stimulating and very interesting. In the end you get out what you put in. If you need motivation, find your dinosaur and do it!
