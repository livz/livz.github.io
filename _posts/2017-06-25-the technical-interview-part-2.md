In an attempt to solve the problems described in 
[Part 1](https://livz.github.io/2017/06/10/the-technical-interview-part-1.html), some companies came up with 
a different approach: the technical challenge - aka _**the homework**_.

A few examples from the security research and software engineering areas include:
* Solving various cracking exercises
* Do a mock vulnerability assessment on a real target under the employer’s control
* Pentest a vulnerable virtual environment
* Analyse a piece of malware and provide a report
* Do a small project from design stages till the end. 

While the benefits of these approaches over the tactics in the previous post are clear, 
there are, however, a few pitfalls. I’m not saying they are not good or useful. 
Just the way we approach them is very important, from both sides of the fence. 

From a candidate’s perspective:

1. Establish a clear timeframe
    * You need to make sure that there is a clear ending to the challenge (see rule no 4). 
    Find out roughly how much time you should allocate for it and possibly how long it took other candidates to complete it. Otherwise you might end up wasting time.
2. Discuss the terms from square one
Before doing actual work on any challenge or project, make sure you really want to work for that company. If it’s not Google, have a discussion beforehand to understand the position you’re applying for and the relevance of the challenge. 
What is the purpose of the challenge? Is it evaluating report writing capabilities, logical thinking, technical investigation skills? Find out as much as you can in advance.
Stay focused on the situation
Be aware of any influence principles at work. Some employers will try to exploit their authority position. Using phrases like “Are you up for …”, “Now is your time to ..”, “Use everything  you know to ..”, “Feel free to impress us with …” can get candidates committed to solve the problem at hand.
However, this will escalate quickly when you don’t have a clear purpose
Clear purpose
Approach the interview challenge with a clear purpose. Your time is limited. Your goal could be “Do everything I can in 5 hours” or “Exploit the FTP server and get root” or even “Write a good report and highlight all the vulnerabilities found and mitigations” (if that’s your speciality). 
Because this is not possible with all challenges, you need to know where to stop! It’s perfectly reasonable to add a list of future task you would do next. 
Errors
An interview challenge can be clear and well written or it can fall short of expectations (to put it mildly) in this area. Whatever the case may be, this tells something about the person who wrote it.
The first type of errors are grammar errors. Not the end of the world but still.
Secondly and more important, if you find technical errors, or errors the context, things that don’t add up, it would be a good thing to flag this with your interviewer.
If somebody cannot invest time in doing a proper review of the exercises before releasing them, it seems legitimate to ask, why would you?
