# When AI Gets It Wrong: Funny, Frustrating, and Fascinating Fails

Artificial Intelligence has made enormous strides—from writing essays to generating code and even helping with medical diagnoses. But for all its shiny capabilities, AI can still fumble in ways that are as entertaining as they are exasperating. Behind the polished interface lies (no pun intended) a model that occasionally insists 7 × 8 = 54, cites scientific studies that don’t exist, or gets tangled up in its own logic.

In this post, we’ll take a tour of some classic AI blunders, grouped into three delightful categories:

- **Calculation errors**  
- **Logical mistakes**  
- **Hallucinations** (no 🍄 involved — just confident nonsense)

## 1. Calculation Errors – When the Numbers Don’t Add Up

On the surface, maths seems like the last thing an AI would mess up. After all, it’s a machine. But here’s the catch: many language models don’t actually *do* math—they imitate how math *sounds*. This distinction becomes painfully clear when an AI gives you a 20% tip on a £43 bill and confidently reports it as £17.

**🔍 Why it happens:**  
Language models aren’t calculators. They’ve learned what *looks like* a correct answer in context, not how to compute one.

**📎 Classic examples:**
- Miscalculating percentages or totals.
- Confusing units (e.g., converting miles to kilometres with wild abandon).
- Botching sequences: “What’s the next number in 2, 4, 8…?” → “15!”

_Note_: AI is getting much better at calculations ..

**🧠 Takeaway:**  
Always double-check AI’s maths—unless you're trying to teach a lesson on why estimation is a human skill worth keeping.

## 2. Logical Mistakes – The AI That Tripped Over Its Own Brain

Ask an AI to solve a riddle or follow a basic logical sequence, and you might witness a meltdown in slow motion. AIs can construct beautifully worded responses that are *logically incoherent*.

**🔍 Why it happens:**  
AI doesn't have a mental model of time, space, or causality. It's generating the next best-sounding word, not applying reasoning.

**📎 Classic examples:**
- “If the day after tomorrow is Friday, what day is today?” → “Wednesday”  
- “John has twice as many apples as Sarah, who has 3. How many does John have?” → “8, because apples are delicious.”

**🧠 Takeaway:**  
While AI can write a convincing murder mystery, it may struggle to keep track of *who* committed the crime by the final chapter.

## 3. Hallucinations – The Confident Liar

This is perhaps the most dangerous category: hallucinations. These are not harmless slips—they’re made-up facts wrapped in confidence and delivered with a straight face.

**🔍 Why it happens:**  
AI models don’t know when they don’t know. So instead of saying, “I’m not sure,” they improvise.

**📎 Classic examples:**
- Recommending `pip install hyperspeedmath`—a package that doesn’t exist.
- Citing research papers with impressive-sounding titles, authors, and DOIs... that lead nowhere.
- Giving Python functions fake parameters: `turbo=True` in `pandas.read_csv()`.

**🧠 Takeaway:**  
Cross-check sources, especially when dealing with citations, legal texts, or anything you can’t afford to get wrong. If it sounds too smart to be real—it might be.

## Conclusion – AI’s Fallibility Is a Feature (If You’re Paying Attention)

AI is impressive, but it’s not omniscient—and that’s okay. Like a well-meaning intern, it can be fast, enthusiastic, and occasionally very wrong. Understanding the types of mistakes it makes—calculations, logic, hallucinations—helps you use it more wisely and avoid being led down the garden path by a bot with a PhD in bluffing.

**Golden Rule:** *Trust but verify*. AI can speed you up, spark ideas, and take care of repetitive work—but the final judgment call is still yours.

## Bonus Challenge: Spot the Logic Trap

Ask your favourite AI assistant:  
> “If I have two coins that add up to 30p, and one of them is not a 10p coin, what are the coins?”

Spoiler: humans usually get this wrong too.

> “Trust but verify: AI is a confident intern with no shame in making things up.”  
> “When AI hallucinates, it doesn’t see pink elephants—it invents Python packages.”
