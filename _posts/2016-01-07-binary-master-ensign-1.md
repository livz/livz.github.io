At one point I _stumbled_  over the Certified Secure Binary Mastery challenges. 
They are not terribly difficult and _each one of them has an interesting element_. This makes them _accessible and fun_. 

In this blog posts and the following four I'll go through the [Ensign](https://www.certifiedsecure.com/certification/view/37) levels. As described, these ones deal with _retro exploitation techniques_ like buffer overflows, format strings
off-by-one errors and so on. No recent security mitigations are involved in the Ensign levels (E.g.: ASLR or non-executable stack). Don't worry too much about this yet, because their complexity increases to keep the hackers _in flow_.

I hope it goes without saying that these blog posts shouldn't be used as a way to cheat in any case, but as a learning oportunity. With this in mind, let's begin with **Level 1**.

## 0 - Discovery


## 1 - Vulnerability


## 2 - Exploitation


## 3 - Profit
