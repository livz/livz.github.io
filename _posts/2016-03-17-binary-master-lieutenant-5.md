We're finally reached the last level of [Lieutenant](https://www.certifiedsecure.com/certification/view/37) set of challenges from **Certified Secure Binary Mastery**. In this post we'll analyse an encrypted communication protocol based on [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange). If you're not familiar with the protocol, please study it beforehand since it is very important in general, not only for solving challenges. In a nutshell, **_DH key exchange is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over an insecure channel_**. And that's exactly what's happening here: Alice and Bob first establis ha secret key, which Alice then uses it to send the final password to Bob,
