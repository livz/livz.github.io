The challenge for this edition of SecTalks includes a good mix of topics: encryption, JavaScript obfuscations and interesting custom steganography. Something for everyone. Since my solution is a bit different than the winning solution I've decided to post it here, hoping it will be useful. Not knowing much about how images are loaded in HTML as base64 encoded data, I went for a brute-force approach, which actually worked quite well. But more on this later. Let's download the [page] (/files/page.zip) and get started!
