<h1><i>MacOS tips for a smooth transition</i></h1>
	<h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>Here I've gathered tips that have helped me work with MacOS more efficiently, from general usage to OS internals. If you're a reverese engineer transitioning from Windows or Linux to MacOS you might find here useful information about binary analysis, debugging, tracing, tools and scripts. </p>

<p>Most of them are short and concise, because the last thing you want about productivity tips are long pages overloaded with information. As with anything, your mileage may vary between different OSX versions. <i>Enjoy!</i></p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
	<ul class="tip">
	  {% assign items = (site.tips | sort: 'date') | reverse %}
		{% for tip in items %}
		<li>
			<span>{{ tip.date | date_to_string }}</span>
			Â»
			<a href="{{ tip.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}" title="{{ tip.title }}">{{ tip.title }}</a>
		</li>
		{% endfor %}
	</ul>
