<h2>.: About Me</h2>

My name is Liviu I. and I am an IT security enthusiast. I know that the phrase will become eventually cliché as Infosec domain becomes more and more like a job and less like a passion. Anyways...I have been in the industry since 2002 working in various from exploit research to forensics, pentesting and more recently into threat response. I am experienced with Linux, Mac and windows if I have to.

I like to develop security tools and do security research,  that sometimes I presented at UK security events like BSides, OWASP London, 44Con. In my (continuously shrinking) spare time, I get involved in the security community events and into organizing [London stack Smashers](https://www.meetup.com/London-Stack-Smashers/) meetup.

<h2>.: Passions</h2>

I like solving problems, techincal but not only. There is actually one on the main page of this site. 

I'm usually curious about how things work.

I like to organise things, plan activities and see projects realised. Although it might sound boring and some people think that this kills creativity, I believe that in the end this actually allows even more time to think and be creative when everything is in place.

I love learning and sharing knowledge, and helping people in general.
