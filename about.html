<h2>.: About Me</h2>
My name is Liviu and I am an IT security enthusiast. I know that the phrase will become eventually clich√© as Infosec domain becomes more and more like a job and less like a passion but anyways.. I have been in the industry since 2002 working in various areas from exploit research to forensics, pentesting and more recently into threat response. I am experienced with Linux, Mac and even Windows if I have to.
</br></br>
I like to develop security tools and do security research,  that sometimes I present at UK security events like BSides, OWASP London, 44Con. In my (continuously shrinking) spare time, I get involved in the security community events and I am organizing the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Stack-Smashers/">London stack Smashers</a> meetup.

<h2>.: Passions</h2>
<ul>
<li>I like solving problems, techincal but not only. There is actually one on the main page of this site. </li>
<li>I'm usually curious about how things work.</li>
<li>I like to organise things, plan activities and see projects realised. Although it might sound boring and some people think that this kills creativity, I believe that in the end this actually allows even more time to think and be creative when everything is in place.</li>
  <li>I love learning and sharing knowledge, and helping people in general.</li>
</ul>
